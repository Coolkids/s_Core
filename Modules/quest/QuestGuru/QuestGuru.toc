# This has driven me crazy for the past week when I found that Blizzard
# broke this addon completely (along with the tracker. I have had to
# reverse engineer many addons to get a working quest log. It is still
# a work in progress so bear with me. Thanks to Classic Quest Log, BugSack,
# and a few quest log addons that I have completely forgotten their name.
# I am lucky right now if I remember my own name. Cheers
